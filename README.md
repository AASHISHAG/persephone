## MAM
A tool for development of CTC-based acoustic models for low-resource scenarios implemented in Python/tensorflow. The goal we are working towards is making the deployment of automatic phoneme transcription simple for linguists.

The code is useable, but is going through a transitional period and documentation is mostly nonexistent. I'm happy to offer direct help to anyone who wants to use it. Contact me at oliver.adams@gmail.com.

When the redesign is complete the tool will be released under a new name.

# Requirements
* Tensorflow (API v1.0 used in development)
* Python 3 (3.5 used in development).
* python_speech_features (v0.5 used in development).
* Kaldi if pitch features are desired.

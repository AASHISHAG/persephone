## Persephone

Persephone (/pərˈsɛfəni/) is an automatic phoneme transcription tool for
low-resource languages. It is designed for situations where the traditional
speech recognition pipeline, which depends on a large pronunciation lexicon and
substantial training data, is inapplicable because of the lack of such a
lexicon.

The goal is to make state-of-the-art phonemic transcription accessible.

The tool is implemented in Python/Tensorflow. Currently implemented is a
CTC-based model.

The user interface and APIs are a work in progress. I'm happy to offer direct
help to anyone who wants to use it. Contact me at oliver.adams@gmail.com.
